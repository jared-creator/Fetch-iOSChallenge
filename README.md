# iOS Challenge for Fetch

This app was made as a take home project for Fetch iOS Apprenticeship 

## What is it?

This app fetches dessert details via https://themealdb.com/api.php. I utilized MVVM to produce a clean and productive code base with commented code. As required, I used async/await to fetch the details needed to show the user.
